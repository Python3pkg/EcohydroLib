# 1.15 - 11/6/2013
  - Revised handling of SSURGO attribute data to use GeoJSON instead of GML, which avoids problems 
    introduced by GML schema validation used under newer versions of GDAL/OGR (1.10+)

# 1.14 - 10/18/2013
  - Updated ecohydrolib.ssurgo.attributequery to no longer require PySimpleSoap,
    version 1.10 of which had broken compatibility with SSURGO tablular queries

# 1.13 - 9/27/2013
  - Made NED 30m the default coverage type to download via GetDEMExplorerDEMForBoundingBox
    (previous default was SRTM 30m USA)
  - Added leafc and rootdepth raster map types

# 1.12 - 9/25/2013
  - Added workflow command RunCmd.py for capturing arbitrary commands in the processing history
    of the metadata associated with a project

# 1.11 - 8/23/2013
  - Fixed GetSSURGOFeaturesForBoundingbox.py and GenerateSoilPropertyRastersFrom* to support
    newly modified GML format returned by USDA's Soil Data Mart WFS
  - Added API calls to ecohydrolib.nhdplus2.networkanalysis for finding first-order upstream stream reaches
  - Updated ecohydrolib.nhdplus2.networkanalysis.getCatchmentFeaturesForGage to return a catchment polygon
    with internal rings dissolved into the exterior polygon 

# 1.1 - 7/30/2013
  - Added ability to query NHDPlus2 dataset for streamflow gage location using
    new EcohydroLib CGI hosted at RENCI
  - Added the follow attributes to soils data downloaded from SSURGO:
    + chorizon.wthirdbar_r (i.e. water content at field capacity)
    + chorizon.awc_r (i.e. plant available moisture content)
    + derived value drainable moisture content (prosity - water content at field capacity)
  - Added isohyet raster type
  - Note: Version number is 1.1 indicating that metadata from this version is not compatible
    with previous versions

# 1.01 - 7/19/2013
